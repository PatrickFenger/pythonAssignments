It's a quite simple program, you copy it into whatever IDE/Console you like, and run it there. 
It will print out the answers for the excercise. 

You need to have a webget with the function download accesible for the file, if you don't you can download a [webget file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PatrickFenger/pythonAssignments/master/Assignment_1/webget.py)

Or install through your console with for example pip install .
