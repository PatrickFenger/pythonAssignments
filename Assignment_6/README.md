Upon running the file, the program will conduct a download process to retrive the neccesary dataset & produce answers for the questions listed below.

## Questions

1. What is the most used words in the songs?
2. How many times are each word repeated in a song? (Or        perhaps - what song repeats the top 4 repeated words        the most? - finds the most repetitive song)
3. What song uses the word "X" the most time? (X meaning a     specific word, choose your own!)
4. What is the average number of words per song?
5. Show the distribution of number of words in the songs.      (Example: how many songs have 5-10 words, 10-20 words)


## Answers:

### Q1:

To make the answer a bit more solid we invalidated the following words:
"THE", "I", "YOU", 'AND', 'TO', 'A', 'ME', "T", "S", 'MY', 'IN', 'IT', 'M', "ON", 'THAT', 'OF', 'YOUR', 'ALL', 'FOR', 'WE', 'IS', 'BE', 'KNOW', 'UP', 'LIKE', 'BUT', 'GET', 'SO', 'WITH'

After removing these words, we concluded that the most used word is: "Love"
