## How to run file
So the python file can be executed through the terminal with the following command.

python run.py

You can add a argument. This argument should be the path to the title.basics.tsv file.
An example of this could be - 

python run.py path/title.basics.tsv

By doing this the program will use the specified file.

If you dont provide the argument, the script will will look for the title.basics.tsv in the directory where the script is placed. If it doesnt find the file here it will download the file from https://github.com/PatrickFenger/pythonAssignments/blob/master/Assignment_4/title.basics.tsv

The easiest way to run the program is to fork the repo and call the command - python run.py
By doing this all the files the script will have the files it needs to run.
