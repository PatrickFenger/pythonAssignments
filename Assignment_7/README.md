## Questions

1. What main-category of project has the highest success rate?
2. For the main-category of project with highest success rate (question above), what is the category with the highest number of project proposals?
3. What is the median pledged amount (usd_pledged_real) of successfully funded projects?
4. What is the number of successfully funded projects with more than 5.000$ pledged 
   (usd_pledged_real) per category?
5. For the main-category with the most successfully funded projects (quantity, not rate of success), what is the goal-           
    amount range (usd_goal_real), e.g. range 0-10k$ , 5-15k$, 100k$-110k$, that contains the most successfully funded   
    projects (in quantity, not rate of success)?
