#Project info

After some general debate within the group we concluded two possible fun projects we would like to engage in depending on the difficulty reflections throughout the process. First option is to write a program that are able to process your receipt in an archive every time you do groceries. This would solve the whole "keeping the receipt issue" aswell as making it easier to get an overview and maintain records, should you be in a situation where you have shared accounts/records. Second option is to get our hands dirty and write the program for Global Contrast based Salient Region Detection as recommended from Helge (link provided below)
